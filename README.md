## **Project Description**

As part of the Coder Academy Hackathon, we decided to build a weather app. This was an idea that won against creating a pomodoro type app that allowed the user to assign timed tasks for the day and a website show-casing student coders.

We felt a weather app would provide more of a learning curve and aswell as allow the consideration and implementation of a greater number of features.



## Purpose

This web app will serve two main purposes. The first is to allow vehicle owners to book a safe parking spot near a desired location for a certain period of time in the Melbourne, Australia. The other is to allow the manager of the company to manage these parking spots and bookings.

Let's call the Toy Robot "Tony"







## Functionality / Features

Not all features of the site will be available to all users of the web app. This is due to the different types of users expected to use the application. Without logging in all users are able to:

- **Place** Tony 
- **Move** Tony within a grid of 5x5 units

- Rotate Tony to the **Left**
- Rotate Tony to the **Right**

- **Report** Tony's position 



## Future Development:

As it stands some features were not included due to time constraints and in future we would love to add them. These features are:

- Re-booking previous locations

- Leaving & Viewing Ratings

- Google Login

- View a summary of all daily bookings

  

## Tech Stack

**Front-end**: REACT.JS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and Style-Component

**Deployment**: Back-end: AWS Front-end: AWS

**Project-management tools**: Trello

**DevOps**: Git, Github, VS Code



## Testing

The application has been tested in Chrome on Mac OS.

During development, the applications underwent few unit function tests due to time constraints. However, it is recommended that the production version of the application undergo both automated and manual testing using tools such as JEST and Cypress.



## Project management

We have selected Trello as our planning methodology as it is easier to visualize tasks and allows us to manage the project by separating the tasks into cards and prioritizing major ones. Another tool used is Discord which is a voice, video, and text communication app. This is essential as it is essential to keep contact with each other.
